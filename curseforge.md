Adds `dump` hotkeys to the game that dumps the currently rendered models to a file.
The output file is a `.obj` file that can be opened in any 3D modelling software and the required textures are also dumped. The model is uv mapped, so the textures should be applied correctly.
Currently works with:

- Players
- Entities

Everything connected to the player or entities like armor, held items, capes, 3d skin layers, etc. is also dumped.

## Dependencies

- none
